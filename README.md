How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Many user needs will be provided by the customer.  It may be helpful to conduct interviews or surveys to get an idea of what features might be useful.  Creating user stories out of user needs helps the team to identify what goals they are trying to accomplish and how they will be applied so they can make a plan to implement them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

It’s a good to have a clear idea of what needs to be done and how it will help the user.  From there, it’s best to make a plan and develop one or a few user stories at a time, meeting the requirements but keeping it simple so it’s easy to change later.  In the future, I hope to be able to use sprints (or something similar) that allow for the flexibility of frequent testing and regular input from the customer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member communicates effectively with their team, updating them on their progress and making them aware of any roadblocks that have come up.  They use their strength to the best of their ability and offer helpful input when the opportunity arises.  They take responsibility for their work and for the project.
